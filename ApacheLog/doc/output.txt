The report itself should show the following information:

    Top 10 countries for visitors
        include the name of the country in English and the number of visitors 
           from that country
        sort the results by number of visitors (most to least)
        for each country show the page other than / that visitors from that 
           country visited the most
    Top 10 US states, ignoring visitors outside the US
        same as above for output

For the purposes of this code, "the page" is the path including the query 
string.

If there are less than 10 states or countries with visitors, only show those 
which have at least one visitor.

Note that the GeoLite2 data file may simply not have all the relevant 
information on some IP addresses. In this case, assign the visit to a state 
or country of "unknown" as needed.
