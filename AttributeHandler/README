Attribute Handlers

   Proof of concept:
   Try to create a way to filter named test(s) to executed
   using perl's subroutine attributes with arguments.

   myconfig.json   # Potential configuration file to declare
                   # subtest name to include and/or exclude

   AHsinglefile.t  # Concept in one file

   # Concept modularized
   MyAttributeHandler.pm  # Attribute defined
   MySubs.pm              # Attribute Subroutine
   AHmodular.t            # test program using methods and subroutines
